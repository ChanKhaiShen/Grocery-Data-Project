This folder contains a Python project to compare sequential processing and parallel processing of raw data.

In all experiments, thousands of dummy transactions of grocery purchases are generated to a cloud database and then 
fetched to be processed. The processing time of sequential processing and parallel processing are recorded. 

The processing is to summarize the transactions in a record of the sales information of each item. All results are 
stored in Dummy analysis results folder.

Time analysis results folder contains the results of all experiments:

-Sequential processing time of different number of transactions
